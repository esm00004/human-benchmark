    <h2>About the test</h2>
    <p>This is a simple tool to measure your reaction time.</p>
    <p>
        The average (median) reaction time is 273 milliseconds, according to
        <a href="">the data</a>
        collected so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to measuring your reaction time, this test is affected by the 
        latency of your computer and monitor. Using a fast computer and low latency
         / high framerate monitor will improve your score.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scores in this test are faster than the
        <a href="">aim trainer</a>
        test, because you can react instantly without moving the cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is discused in further detail on the the
        <a href="">statistics</a>
        page. While an average human reaction time may fall between 200-250ms, 
        your computer could be adding 10-50ms on top. Some modern TVs add as much as 150ms!
